# Monkey Island
## Insult Battle

This is the first project at Ironhack Web Development Course. It's a quiz game for 1 player.
The game is based on the classic point and click game from the 90's Monkey Island.
One of the most famous scenes are the insult battle between Guybrush Threepwood and a bunch of pirates in order to train his insult abilities.

## Challenges
- CSS responsive
- DOM
- dealing with different browsers

## What I learn
- media queries
- add audio to website
- comment all the code is harder than it seems

## Things to improve

- use debugger instead of console.log

## TODO

## Highlights
- language options
- use of JSDoc standards to comment code and generate documentation.
- dry and clean javascript
